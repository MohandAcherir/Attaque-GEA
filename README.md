# Cryptanalysis of GEA-1 and GEA-2

**GEA-1** and **GEA-2** are encryption algorithms used for securing data in mobile communications within the **GPRS** - General Packet Radio Service - standard.\
These stream ciphers were designed to provide confidentiality for user data transmitted over the network.

**GEA-1**: Known for being intentionally weakened with a 40-bit encryption key, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Due to its insecurity, it was deprecated in modern systems.\
**GEA-2**: An improvement over GEA-1, offering better security with a 64-bit key. However, it too has been shown to have weaknesses and is considered outdated by today's standards.\

The goal of this project is to analyse, understand and code the exploit of these known attacks.
